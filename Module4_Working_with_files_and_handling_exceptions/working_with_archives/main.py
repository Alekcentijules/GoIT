# In addition to working with archives, the shutil module can also perform the following high-level operations on the file system:
# -shutil.copy(src, dst) copies a file from src to dst. If dst is a directory, the file is copied with its current name to that directory.
# -shutil.copytree(src, dst) recursively copies the entire src directory to dst.
# -shutil.move(src, dst) moves the file or directory src to dst.
# -shutil.rmtree(path) recursively deletes the path directory.
# -shutil.disk_usage(path) returns the disk usage statistics, including total volume, used volume and free volume for the given path.


# source_file = "/path/to/source/file.txt"
# destination_dir = "/path/to/destination"
# shutil.copy(source_file, destination_dir)

# source_dir = "/path/to/source/directory"
# destination_dir = "/path/to/destination/directory"
# shutil.copytree(source_dir, destination_dir)
