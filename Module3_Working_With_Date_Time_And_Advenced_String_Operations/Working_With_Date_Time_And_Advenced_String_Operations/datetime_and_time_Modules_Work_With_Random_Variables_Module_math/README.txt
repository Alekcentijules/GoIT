Key aspects: methods for working with dates and times

 1. datetime.now(): The method returns a datetime object containing the current date and time. 
 2. datetime.date(): This method returns a date object that represents only the date (no time). 
 3. datetime.time(): This method returns a time object that represents only the time (no date). 
 4. datetime.combine(date, time): This method is used to combine the date and time objects and create a new datetime object. 
 5. datetime(year, month, day, hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0): The constructor of the datetime class allows you to create a datetime object with a specific date and time. 
 6. weekday(): The method determines the number of the day of the week for the specified date, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
 Methods for comparing datetime objects:
 - == (equality): Compares whether two dates are equal. 
 - != (inequality): Compares whether two dates are not equal. 
 - < (less than): Determines if one date is less than the other. 
 - > (greater than): Determines if one date follows another. 
 - <= (less than or equal to): Compares whether one date is less than or equal to another. 
 - >= (greater than or equal to): Compares whether one date is greater than or equal to another.
